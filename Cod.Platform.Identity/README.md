# Cod.Platform.Identity

Cod.Platform.Identity provides abstractions, dependency injection modules, and helpers for integrating identity and access management into .NET applications. It enables secure authentication, role management, and entitlement checks for business apps.

## What is this project about?
- Defines interfaces and services for identity, authentication, and authorization.
- Provides DI modules for registering identity services and configuration.
- Supports role-based access control and entitlement management.
- Used by consumer projects to standardize and secure identity integration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the NuGet Package
Add the package to your .NET project:
dotnet add package Cod.Platform.Identity
### 2. Register Identity Services in Dependency Injection
In your application's startup or DI configuration:
using Cod.Platform.Identity;

builder.Services.AddPlatformIdentity(options =>
{
    options.DefaultRole = "User";
    // Configure additional options as needed
});
### 3. Use Identity Services in Your Application
using Cod.Platform.Identity;

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IIdentityService _identityService;
    public MyService(IIdentityService identityService)
    {
        _identityService = identityService;
    }
    // Use _identityService for authentication, role checks, etc.
}
